<h2>Info</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        This repository is made so I could turn my ideas into some sort of GUI ideas.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I run?🤔</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        To run this you must have <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">pipenv</a> installed.
        In order to install pipenv do
        ```bash
        pip install pipenv
        ```
    </li>
    <li>
        After you install pipenv, perform the following commands
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/sargam-poudel/pygame/
        ```
    </li>
    <li>After you clone the repo, do the following commands
        ```bash
        pipenv install Pipfile
        ```
        and to get virtual environment
        ```bash
        pipenv shell
        ```
    </li>
    <li>After all that hassle, go into the actual project directory and run the required script.</li>
</ul>
